- A pretrained network is a model that has already been trained on a dataset.  
- Such networks produce useful results immediately after loading the network parameters.
- Put the network into eval mode for the dropout and batch normalization layers to work properly before making inferences. 
- Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have two partsâ€”the generator and the discriminatorâ€”that work together to produce output indistinguishable from
authentic items. 
- CycleGAN uses an architecture that supports converting back and forth between two different classes of images.
- Torch Hub is a standardized way to load models and weights from any project with an appropriate hubconf.py file.
